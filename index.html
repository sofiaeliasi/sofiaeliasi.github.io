    <h2 class="A"><i>The Awakening</i></h2>
    <div class="section1">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Awakening</i> is a novel written by Kate Chopin that was published in 1899. 
            The novel details Edna Pontellier’s endeavor to attain a sense of independence in a late 1800s Southern 
            society that has very specific, restrictive standards for women.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chopin’s use of music in the novel is notable. Edna’s awakening can be easily 
            traced through the music that appears in the novel. As different characters in the story play music, 
            Edna experiences different emotions. For example, Mademoiselle Reisz, one of the most important influences 
            in Edna’s awakening, is a pianist who plays Frederic Chopin’s Fantaisie-Impromptu, opus 66. This piece was 
            written in 1834, but was not published until after Chopin’s death in 1855. Listening to this piece evokes a wide 
            array of emotions in Edna; the first time she listens to it, her awakening first becomes apparent. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows deepened in the little room. The music grew strange and fantastic—
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turbulent, 
                insistent, plaintive and soft with entreaty. The shadows grew deeper. 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music filled the room. It floated out 
                upon the night, over the housetops, the 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crescent of the river, losing itself in the silence of the upper air. 
                Edna was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sobbing, just as she had wept one midnight at Grand Isle when strange, new voices 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awoke in her. She 
                arose in some agitation to take her departure. (Chopin 69)
            <br><br>
            Music continues to be an important part of Edna’s awakening; specifically, Polish Frederic Chopin’s unique
             music significantly transforms her awakening. “Her evolving perspicacity throughout the narrative has much 
             to do with the subtle and inescapable harmony of Frederic Chopin, a primary muse for <i>The Awakening</i>” (Camastra 154).
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This novel was published in 1899; the earliest known device for recording sound 
            was the phonautograph, which was invented in 1857. Phonographs were invented in 1877 and are considered 
            the first example of home audio that people could own and use in their homes. Edna would only have been 
            able to listen to music through a phonograph, which did not have a very high-quality sound output, or live.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are currently listening to Chopin’s Fantaisie-Impromptu.

    <h2><i>The Great Gatsby</i></h2>
    <div class="section2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Great Gatsby</i> is a novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald that was published in 1925. The novel is set in the 1920s and tells the story of a millionaire named Jay Gatsby, who lives on Long Island, and his ambitions to pursue Daisy Buchanan, a woman that he loved when he was younger. The novel is narrated by a man named Nick Carraway.
            <br><br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music plays a very large role in <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. It was written in the 1920s, which is considered the “Jazz Age” (a term that Fitzgerald himself largely popularized through the publication of this novel). Music popular during this time was written by musicians such as Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, and Duke Ellington. Most of the jazz musicians and composers of the time were African Americans, which led to complex political issues as most African Americans were living under Jim Crow laws at the time and this music was simultaneously very popular.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music is always playing at Gatsby’s grand parties, both outside and inside. One of the many rooms in his house is devoted to music. In the novel, music symbolizes energy and excitement at most of its appearances (of which there are numerous).
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1920s (which is when this novel is set), the phonograph and radio were the most popular and available modes of listening to music. However, most of the musical mentions in the book are of live music. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are currently listening to “The Love Nest” by Otto Harbach and Louis A. Hirsch, a song that a character named Klipspringer plays in Gatsby’s music room.

    <h2><i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i></h2>
    <div class="section3">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> is a novel written by Zora Neale Hurston that was published in 1937. Set in central and southern Florida in the 1930s, this novel is the story of Janie Crawford and her search for love.
            <br><br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While references to actual songs, pieces, or composers are not incredibly prevalent in this novel, there are many mentions of music and musical instruments that are used as metaphors for other things. For example, Janie describes, “It was like a flute song forgotten in another existence and remembered again. What? How? Why? This singing she heard that had nothing to do with her ears” (42). Songs are used to communicate ideas and spread stories. Tea Cake, Janie’s last love, plays the guitar for her. With his guitar, Tea Cake brings joy to Janie and his community. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big band and swing were popular styles of music in the 1930s. Famous composers included Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. The radio became more popular in the 1930s as the phonograph became less widely used. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting interpretation is that Hurston actually uses the three fundamental components of blues music – rhythm, rhyme, and repetition – in her writing. Katherine Anne Zimmerman discusses how “twelve-bar blues is the most common form of blues; the stanzas in this form consist of three lines where the singer repeats the first line and improvises a third, rhyming line, known as the AAB rhyme scheme,” how “each bar traditionally contains four beats which creates a steady, solid meter,” and how this pattern reflects how Hurston wrote her novel (Zimmerman 3-4). 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are currently listening to "Cheek to Cheek" by Irving Berlin that was written in 1934-35 and was popular at the time of the publication of <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i>.

    <h2><i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i></h2>
    <div class="section4">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i> is a play written by Tennessee Williams that was published in 1947. It is the story of Blanche DuBois, a narcissistic woman who moves in with her sister, Stella, and Stella’s husband, Stanley. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the other three literary works mentioned in this project, <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i> is a play, which means that it was written to be performed and that every detail in the play must be thought out so that it can be appropriately performed. The first (and arguably most important) musical reference that Williams integrated into the first draft of the play was the “Varsouviana,” which is a polka tune (Davison 404). The name “Varsouviana” is derived from French and Spanish, and it means “from Warsaw.” This is an interesting detail because Stanley, Stella’s husband, is Polish and his Polish background plays a large part in the play. Throughout the play, the Varsouviana appears when Blanche’s husband shoots himself and as she falls further prey to her increasing insanity. A “blue piano” is also heard when Blanche is feeling lonely or depressed. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the 1940s, radio was by far the most popular way to listen to music. Music was also becoming popular as soundtracks in movies became more prevalent. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are currently listening to “The Varsouviana” performed by Bob Arbuckle, Verner Mikkelson, and N. Roy Clifton.
